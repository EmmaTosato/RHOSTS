# Agent Rules Configuration

This document provides instructions for AI agents working in this project environment.

When working in a new project, agents should read this README first to understand the how the rules for agent are organized.

## File Structure

### Agent Rules (`agent-rules*.md`)
Contains general rules for agents operating in this environment:
- If the filename contains `-local`, you are working in a local development environment
- If the filename contains `-pncserver`, you are working on the PNC server environment
- Additional environment types may be added with corresponding filename suffixes

### Project Specific (`specific-project.md`)
Contains project-specific configurations, including:
- Conda environment names
- Project-specific directory structures
- Special requirements or configurations for this particular project

## Agent Instructions

### Getting Started
1. Read the appropriate `agent-rules*.md` file based on your environment
2. Read `specific-project.md` for project-specific configurations
3. Follow both sets of rules when working in this project

### File Management
- Modify rule files as needed to adapt to project requirements
- Maintain consistency between general and project-specific rules
- Ensure all changes align with the project's development workflow

### Communication Guidelines
- **Documentation and code**: Use English and avoid emoticons unless explicitly requested
- **Chat conversations**: Use Italian or English based on the user's language preference
- **Chat conversations**: Emoticons are acceptable but use them sparingly


This README will be updated when new environment types are added.
